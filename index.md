##### SORCIERES, 2021-03-04 ‚Äì ‚Ä¶



## Idea:

-    The idea is <u>simple</u>.
-    The exhibition is about witches.
-    There is a stress on feminist, suffragist, patriarchist aspect.
-    This aspect is still relevant in modern times, yet numerous people find it superficial, histeric, attention-seeking.
-    There is no need to convince the converted and despite we generally aim for both men and women of every age-group, (and non-binary), a young men, being a tougher nut to crack, is our main goal.
-    We want to persuade them with provocative communication, relying massively on dark humour, as we believe it is the most efficent way to get into someone‚Äôs head and enabling him to process the horror of women, while not making him defensive about it.
-    OUR CORE TARGET is Anouk‚Äôs brother, who is a 20 y.o. white boi, smart, but perhaps a bit lazy-minded and indifferent to the subject. Maybe he regard it as a past and not relevant today. 



## Main poster as a key-visual:  

+    main content: pictures, caption, 
+    logo + baseline
+    info: date + place



The following caption is meant to be monosize, monostressed, not-hierarchical, bold, wilfully na√Øve, somewhat blunt and candid, bottom-line asmart:



THIS EXHIBITION IS CALLED ‚ÄúSORCIERES‚Äù AND IT IS ABOUT THE  PERSECUTION, BURNING AND BRUTAL MURDER OF 100.000 WOMEN OVER SEVERAL CENTURIES ON ABSURD CHARGES SUCH AS DOING EIGHT-MILE JUMPS, SLEEPING WITH SATAN, BEEING TOO PRETTY OR BEING A FLY. THE EXHIBITION WILL TAKE PLACE AT ESPACE VANDERBORGHT FROM 31.10.2021 TO 31.01.2022.

## Slogans:

The idea is simple: present the fact about the witchhunts, especially cases of feminicide on some absurd charges, like 8km long jumps ‚Üí then juxtapose it with a punchline.

‚ÄúA WOMAN WAS KILLED IN 17xx ON CHARGES OF SMELLING WEIRD.

A WITTY DARK PUNCHLINE‚Äù



#### Examples:

---

A 60 y.o. woman was tortured and burned in Montbeliard in 1652 because someone claimed that she slept with the Lord of Darkness. 

-    But to be honest, burning a woman is pretty dark itself. 
-    Paye ton coup d‚Äôun soir.‚Äâ
-    I MEAN SHE WAS 60 IT <u>IS</u> KINDA GROSS.
-    Category: MATURE

---

Une femme a √©t√© tortur√©e et brul√©e √† Hendaye en 1609 pour avoir fait un bond de 8km.

-    Impossible les filles sont trop mauvaises en sport.
-    Donc les femmes ne sont pas si mauvaises en sport.
-    sSo who said woman were bad at sport?‚Äâ

---

Une femme a √©t√© tortur√©e et brul√©e √† Paris en 1382 pour avoir pr√©par√© une potion pour regagner l‚Äôamour de son mari.
En meme temps qu‚Äôest ce qu‚Äôon ferait pas pour homme.‚Äâ

-    At least she was cooking
-    Yes love is dangerous, but that much?
-    ~~Picked her poison.~~
-    ~~WITCHES BREW.~~

---

Une femme a √©t√© tortur√©e et brul√©e √† Oslo en 1624 parce qu‚Äôelle √©tait ‚Äútrop belle‚Äù.

-    Bah du coup faudrait savoir.‚Äâ
-    So in a man‚Äôs world there are no good options.
-    Pick your poison	

---

~~Une femme a √©t√© tortur√©e et brul√©e √† Oslo en 1624 parce qu‚Äôelle √©tait~~ 

---

Anne Habene - 1630, Selestat (france), **beheaded** - because she arrived at a Sabbat carried by 4 black cats 

-     	    ‚Äã	(‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ)
           Rate your driver 


-    You: :slightly_smiling_face:
     Your Uber Driver: üê± üê± üê± üê±

     Inquisition: :dizzy_face:
     You: :upside_down_face:

     

-    WORST. UBER. EVER.

---

Madelaine Bonis - 1629, Selestat, tortured, beheaded, burned until his body is ashes
Because she slept with the satan because he took the appearance of his husband

-    STN > STD      ;-(
-    random hook-up

---

~~Elsa Mock & his daughter 1 an apr√®s - 1590, herrliberg, sorcellerie~~

---

~~Suzanne Gandry - 1652, Valenciennes - tortured, strangled, burned, then buried in the wood, JUST SAD~~ 

---

Janet Boyman - 1572, edimbourg - execute;;d because she believed in sorcery and healed people.

-    Healer sucked back then either.

-    Healer - the worst hero class since 1572.

     2/10

---

Susannah Martins - 1692, Salem, hanged - forced breast‚Äôs exams they discovered she gave milk in jail

-    top 10 arguments against breastfeeding in public [you won‚Äôt believe number #6].
-    breastfeeding was always controversial. 

---

Doritte Nippers - 1571, Danmark.  Didn‚Äôt pay her taxes, accused, won the case. Accused again for the same crime, but this time with witchcraft. Pled guilty, then burned.

-    :heart: bureau des imp√¥ts *likes this*
-    two times. a charm. dead woman.

-    tax office *likes this*
-    ~~entry into the kingdom of heaven is not free~~
-    ~~They a key to heaven out of gold, it‚Äôs hard to break even after making~~

---

Anne 7 ans, Catharina 8 ans, Christina 9 ans, Barbara 10 ans, Maria 11 ans, Margaretha 13 ans were executed in 1617 in Molsheim for witchraft and magic.

-    I think they missed the 12.



---

Martha Corey - 1692, hanged, Salem - openly laughed at witches trials 

-    WHO‚ÄôS LAUGHING NOW ~~(superbold huge dorky)~~



---

Mattencia de Francesco - 1428 - Rome - burned - she supposedly transformed into a fly.

-    Do you need a comment? (this time)
-    I guess flying is not so safe after all.
-    ~~when pigs fly / pigs might fly~~
-    ~~fly bye~~ 
-    ~~to kill a fly with a sledgehammer~~



---

Women were persecuted for magic and sorcery, burned and killed, often anonymously buried with every sign of their existence vanished and all memory perished.

-    The ultimate disappearing magic trick‚Ä¶



---

Rebecca Nurse was one of the oldest people accused of witchcraft in  Salem. The nail in her coffin, so to speak, was when they straight-up  asked her if she was a witch and she failed to respond because she was  an old lady, slightly deaf, and literally just didn‚Äôt hear them.

-    And you thought missing your UPS was a pain.
-    When you asked them a question for the 4th time and they don‚Äôt answer‚Ä¶
-    Deaf Death 
-    Deaf witch. Death wish.



---

The women accussed of witchcraft would be thrown into deep water. The witches couldn‚Äôt drown, as they were water repelent. Submerged, they could get accidentaly baptised.

-    medieval gore-tex 
-    Witches, first organic waterproof material, or something similar.

2/10 :cry:

## Teaser:

so it must be a slogan from the poster, whole communication is based on witty punchlines, so it would be foolish to do different than so an so as stated. 

1.   maybe a recipe for a millennium-long hatred for woman, like:

-    take a spoon of foolishness, three bits of hatred, pinch of bigotry, burn for and hour on a stake and go back home with a sense of a job well done. (delivered with a witty sarcastic commercial voiceover of a woman lector, like in documentaries)

2.   What‚Äôs the difference between a WITCHES and a B*TCHES?

-    ~~400 years of progress‚Ä¶ but there are some years ahead.~~

-    ~~400 years of reasoning~~

-    100 000 thousands of innocent* deaths

     ‚Äã	*of course if you don‚Äôt believe this nonsense

3.   burned matches, each representing a woman killed. 100.000 of them in a row, perhaps purposely shaped, a footage of burning.
3.   If one cube represent‚Äôs one death of an innocent woman, then we have a looooot of cubes.



## City campaign:

well, that‚Äôs gonna be difficult and irrelevant, as there is literally no one walking on the street right now, but i would 

stairs with death count

-    an installation at Grand Place in BXL. 3D huge words resembling a stake, ready to be ignited. ‚ÄúTHE STAKE IS READY TO PURIFY A WOMAN FROM THE SIN‚Äù

-    

     

## Logo:

I want nothing but a clean logo that doesn‚Äôt draw attention from the rest. Evocative ‚Äì perhaps, but please let it be quiet as middle class with their money. No need to draw attention.

Paradoxally, the logo might be the most difficult, as it shouldn‚Äôt be too autonomous. Too many things all around it.



## Visual Communication:

#### Fonts:

bold, sans, simple, mono-stroke, condensed, massive, fat, stiff,

gothic, overwhelming, displaced(?), crooked, wicked, dense, 

tight, dynamic, tense, strained

gnarled, deceitful, quacked



#### Colors:

bright and bold, so matching the boldness of humour of the slogans. 

punchy, not decided wheter numerous colours or a strict modest palette of, say, 3. 





## Bunch of ideas:

-    throwing more wood into the stake. How to visualize everyone putting a little effort and contribution to burn a witch?
-    burned piece of wood, like a chair (empty chair means a presenece, we can feel a person) or something. Or a wall ‚Äì when you touch it, you get dirty. Either making everyone dirty, or being sarcastic: ‚Äúattention, don‚Äôt touch, danger of getting dirty‚Äù
-    multiple A4 sheets on the wall, one letter per format
-    hay
-    neons
-    huge sentences
